### JS Review

Some Objects, Object Constructors and Loops Oh My!

**Activity 1**

Students use four images to create two objects and two object constructors that will display the properties on the console log. Requirements will be two strings, one boolean, and one integer.

**Activity 2**

Using what you already created and learned from method, make samples of creating and initializing methods using two of the images as your focus.

**Activity 3**

Students use the four characters/images to make an example of printing names in the console log by using loop.
